	abstract = {The American Psychological Association (APA) advocates the use of person-ﬁrst language (e.g., people with disabilities) to refer to individuals with disabilities in daily discourse and to reduce bias in psychological writing. Disability culture advocates and disability studies scholars have challenged the rationale for and implications of exclusive person-ﬁrst language use, promoting use of identity-ﬁrst language (e.g., disabled people). We argue that psychologists should adopt identity-ﬁrst language alongside person-ﬁrst constructions to address the concerns of disability groups while promoting human dignity and maintaining scientiﬁc and professional rigor. We review the evolution of disability language and then discuss the major models used to characterize disability and people with disabilities. The rationale for person-ﬁrst language and the emergence of identity-ﬁrst language, respectively, are linked to particular models. We then discuss some language challenges posed by identity-ﬁrst language and the current intent of person-ﬁrst language, suggesting that psychologists make judicious use of the former when it is possible to do so. We conclude by offering ﬁve observations of ways that use of both person-ﬁrst and identity-ﬁrst language could enhance psychologists’ cultural competence regarding disability issues in personal and scientiﬁc communications.},

	abstract = {There are different words to describe people with an autism diagnosis. For instance, we can put the person before autism (e.g. 'person with autism'), or we can put autism before the person (e.g. 'autistic person'). Previous research showed that autistic adults in English-speaking countries generally liked it better when autism is placed before the person. Yet, people also greatly differ in the words they like and dislike. In this study, we examined word preference in Dutch autistic adults (n = 1026; 16-84 years; 57\% women) and parents of autistic children (n = 286). Via an online questionnaire, we asked our participants to select one term for autistic people that they liked best. The results showed that most adults with autism (68.3\%) and parents (82.5\%) preferred to put the person before autism. Younger adults, with a higher intelligence, and with more autistic traits, were a bit more likely to put autism before the person. We conclude that there are large differences in the words that people prefer. Because we found different results in our Dutch participants compared to participants in English-speaking countries, we think that the Dutch language or culture may also play a role in word preference. For now, we advise autism researchers to use both person-first and autism-first language.},

	issn = {1461-7005},
	doi = {10.1177/13623613221130845},
	abstract = {There is currently disagreement among professionals (such as teachers, therapists, researchers, and clinicians) about the most appropriate and respectful way to refer to individuals with disabilities in general, and those with autism, in particular. Supporters of person-first language feel that it is important to emphasize the person rather than the disorder or disability, and promote the use of terms such as, "person with autism" or "a person with ASD." The goal is to reduce stereotypes and discrimination and emphasize the person's individuality rather than their disability. However, some people within the autism community have questioned the use of person-first terms because they are awkward and use an unconventional style of language that draws attention to the disability. Moreover, autistic individuals and their families are beginning to support the use of identity-first language that embraces all aspects of one's identity. Surveys in the United Kingdom and Australia support the idea that both types of language are preferred by different groups of autism stakeholder groups. In our study, we surveyed autism stakeholders in the United States. Overwhelmingly, autistic adults (n = 299) preferred identity-first language terms to refer to themselves or others with autism. Professionals who work in the autism community (n = 207) were more likely to support and use person-first language. Language is dynamic and our findings support the need for open communication among autism professionals about how we communicate with and about autistic individuals and their families.},

Selected illustrations of preference reversals are presented. A common pattern is that choices involving gains are often risk averse and choices involving losses are often risk taking, even when the only effective difference between 2 problems is that one describes outcomes in terms of lives saved and the other, in terms of lives lost. This pattern also holds for choices regarding monetary outcomes, both hypothetical and real. The effects of frames on preferences are compared to the effects of perspectives on perceptual appearance. The dependence of preferences on the formulation of decision problems is a significant concern for the theory of rational choice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

The authors explore the effectiveness of framing social distancing messages around prosocial vs. self-interested appeals in driving message compliance and helping behavior. The results show that when a message emphasizes benefits for everyone in society, rather than solely for the individual, citizens find the message more persuasive to engage in social distancing, and also more motivating to help others. The results further demonstrate that the proposed effects are higher for individuals who have a lower locus of control and lower fear of coronavirus as prosocial messages lead them to feel a joint responsibility in protecting from the pandemic. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.},

Study 1 provided initial validity information in the form of “stigma profiles” for different disparaged groups. Study 2 replicated and extended those findings and highlighted the utility of including an “average person” baseline. Studies 1 and 2 further demonstrated that the GEMS, together with a humanitarianism-egalitarianism measure (Katz \& Hass, 1988), can predict ambivalent feelings about stigmatized groups. Limitations and potential uses of the measure are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},
