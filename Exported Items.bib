	abstract = {PURPOSE: Parents do not always seek timely help for adolescents when the need arises. Although interventions to increase parental help-seeking have been evaluated and published, no systematic review of these interventions has been conducted. The aim of this systematic review is to collate, synthesise, and evaluate research on help-seeking interventions for parents of adolescents.
METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2020 using terms related to the concepts of "parent" and "help-seeking" and focusing on parents of adolescents (aged 10-19 years). Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies; the Behavioural Change Taxonomy was used to code behavioral change techniques, and "promising interventions" were identified using pre-established criteria.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria, with six rated strong for design and methodology. The most frequently identified Behavioural Change Taxonomies included a credible source delivering the intervention, supporting parents, and providing prompts/cues regarding services/appointments. Four interventions were identified as "promising" because of strong methodology, significant positive outcomes, and strong evidence-base.
CONCLUSIONS: More high-quality, theory-driven parental help-seeking interventions using common outcome measures are needed to advance the literature in this area. Future research should replicate the promising interventions identified to develop best practice guidelines.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To assess the public's recognition of mental disorders and their beliefs about the effectiveness of various treatments (“mental health literacy”). Design: A cross-sectional survey, in 1995, with structured interviews using vignettes of a person with either depression or schizophrenia. Participants: A representative national sample of 2031 individuals aged 18–74 years; 1010 participants were questioned about the depression vignette and 1021 about the schizophrenia vignette. Results: Most of the participants recognised the presence of some sort of mental disorder: 72\% for the depression vignette (correctly labelled as depression by 39\%) and 84\% for the schizophrenia vignette (correctly labelled by 27\%). When various people were rated as likely to be helpful or harmful for the person described in the vignette for depression, general practitioners (83\%) and counsellors (74\%) were most often rated as helpful, with psychiatrists (51\%) and psychologists (49\%) less so. Corresponding data for the schizophrenia vignette were: counsellors (81\%), GPs (74\%), psychiatrists (71\%) and psychologists (62\%). Many standard psychiatric treatments (antidepressants, antipsychotics, electroconvulsive therapy, admission to a psychiatric ward) were more often rated as harmful than helpful, and some nonstandard treatments were rated highly (increased physical or social activity, relaxation and stress management, reading about people with similar problems). Vitamins and special diets were more often rated as helpful than were antidepressants and antipsychotics. Conclusion: If mental disorders are to be recognised early in the community and appropriate intervention sought, the level of mental health literacy needs to be raised. Further, public understanding of psychiatric treatments can be considerably improved.},
