## week 2 assignment 
**description of the data**: the dataset is based on a survey study on US males from 18-26 years old. It studies the impact of informational intervention on HPV vaccination intentions in heterosexual  male. In addition, it also measures several possible moderators (demographic factors, agentic and communal scale) and mediators (trust, attitudes toward vaccination). It is part of my senior/master thesis study.
(note: I am currently doing a pilot study on another project and am expected to have data soon. I might change the dataset over the course of the quarter, and I will send out another email for approval once the data is ready to analyze.)  
**overview of the planned project**: The research question centered on what kind of strategies for informational intervention (self-oriented, partner-oriented, or both) are effective in promoting HPV vaccination for heterosexual male? Specifically, I plan to examine whether HPV vaccination intentions for men differs depending on whether they get a message focused on the harm to themselves (self-oriented) or their current or future partner (partner-oriented).
